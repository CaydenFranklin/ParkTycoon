===================
=: Core Concepts :=
===================

- List the four core concepts, the features they implement, and why each feature
  is an appropriate use of the concept. Incorporate the feedback you got after
  submitting your proposal.

  1. 2D Arrays (no feedback)

  2. Inheritance (no feedback)

  3. JUnit Testing (no feedback)

  4. Recursion (pathing)

=========================
=: Your Implementation :=
=========================

- Provide an overview of each of the classes in your code, and what their
  function is in the overall game.

    Tile(PathTile, LPathTile, TPathTile, ShopTile, GrassTile).
    These are the main game objects that are placed on the board.

    TileHolder(holds the tiles to be placed).

    TycoonManager(manages the current state of the game).




- Were there any significant stumbling blocks while you were implementing your
  game (related to your design, or otherwise)?

  I didn't add JUnit Testing, which was a mistake. I ended up implenting another concept, Novel Linked Data Structures,
  but didn't end up adding JUnit Testing.


- Evaluate your design. Is there a good separation of functionality? How well is
  private state encapsulated? What would you refactor, if given the chance?

  I think it's well done, but I think I could have encapsulated a few concepts better (Tile Size).

  I think functionality is properly seperated.



========================
=: External Resources :=
========================

- Cite any external resources (images, tutorials, etc.) that you may have used 
  while implementing your game.
